# Confirm deployment with issue reactions

This actions allow to create a deployment confirmation job in CI. The job will create a new issue in the repository where the action runs. You can react to the issue with either üëç or üëé to confirm or cancel the deployment confirmation job. 

Usage example:

```yaml
  confirm-dummy-deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: humanizmu/confirm-deployment-with-issue-reactions@v0.2
      with:
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  dummy-deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [confirm-dummy-deployment]
    steps:
    - run: 'echo putin huilo'
```

The example above will creates two jobs
- confirm-dummy-deployment - job that needs to be confirmed by reacting to the issue opened by the job
- dummy-deployment - job depending on the confirmation job

The run containing these jobs will look as following:

## Confirming the deployment

`confirm-dummy-deployment` will automatically create an issue and will log the link to the issue in CI

The issue itself will look like this

You confirm the deployment by reacting to the issue with üëç. Upon confirmation the issue will be closed automatically.

The confirmation job will pass and the dependent deployment step will be triggered

## Cancelling the deployment

You can react to the issue with üëé. Upon cancellation the issue will be closed automatically.

The confirmation job will fail and the dependent deployment step will be skipped
